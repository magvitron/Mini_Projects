Algorithm Psudocode
1. Start :
2. input PV voltage, PV current, Battery % in EV, Battery % in Battery Bank, Grid peak Time.
3. if grid peak time is in between 17:00 and 20:00 or 8:00 to 12:00 then go to 4
4. if Bat%inBattBank < 10% then goto 5 else goto 6
5. Charge from Grid
6. Charge from BattBank

MODE1: PV to Battery
MODE2: PV to Electric Vehicle 
MODE3: Battery Bank to EV
MODE4: AC grid to EV
MODE5: PV to AC grid
