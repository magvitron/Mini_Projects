1. how will the diffrent voltages will be handled
  1.1 How to make it same. Diffrent voltages to single

> Inputs
2. Diffrent voltage -> how did you are managing this?
   1. PV -> we will manage this by the solar power planning: 300 V 2S
   2. EV Battery Charger -> 300V - 500V for EV charger (Ampere: ?) -> New input for me
   3. Grid : 48 -> 300

3.  




car: 300V
